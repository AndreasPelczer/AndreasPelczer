30 years Master Chef turned Mobile Developer | Creator of GastroGrit Omni | Bridging the gap between Professional Kitchens and Digital Efficiency.

"Localization for the real World: GastroGrit Omni is not just bilingual. It supports the languages actually spoken in the 'engine room' of hospitality – from Twi (Ghana) for the stewarding team to Thai for the carving specialists. I build software for the people who do the work."
